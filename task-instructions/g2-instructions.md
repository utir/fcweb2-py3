## Task:

Imagine you are a fact-checker working for a newspaper. You will be presented with various **claims** and asked to evaluate the accuracy of those claims. To help you do this work, for each claim you will also be shown a set of article headlines from various newspapers, as evidence you can consult in making your decision. For example, if a claim were: “Collectively states are paying more on Medicaid than they do on K12 education”, you would read the relevant headlines shown to you, and based on them, rate the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, you will answer whether you agree or disagree with the AI’s prediction of the article stance.

## Specifically, your task is to:

1. **Read** each claim

2. **Read** the relevant evidence presented to you for that claim

3. **Observe** whether each article headline is for, against, or neutral to the claim as predicted by an AI. Note that the AI can make mistakes in predicting stance.

4. **Answer** whether you agree or disagree with the AI’s prediction of the stance.

5. **Answer** whether you agree or disagree with the AI’s prediction of the source’s reputation.

6. **Rate** the accuracy of the claim on a six-point scale (how likely the claim is correct)

7. **Write** 1-2 sentence(s) justifying your rating decision

8. **Guess** the likelihood that others, reading the same information, would agree with you

9. **Complete** a ~3 minute survey 

10. (Optional) We welcome any feedback you have on how we can further improve this task.

We expect a coherent, sincere justification of your rating decision in the writing question above. Incoherent or insincere responses to this question will lead to rejection.  Examples of unacceptable responses include, but are not limited to: copy-paste of the same sentences, a single word repeated over time, or an explanation not related to headline being assessed.  

We will not reject any well-justified answer, provided your task time is also accurately self-reported.
