**Pay.** This task pays up to $15 ($3 base pay + up to $12 in bonus pay).

This fact-checking task will challenge you to work quickly and accurately. You will receive a $1 bonus for every question you answer correctly. If you answer all 12 questions correctly, you will earn the maximum bonus of $12. However, you will only have 10 minutes to answer these questions, so you must also work quickly. Once the 10 minutes have passed, or you have answered all 12 questions, you will be directed to a ~2-minute survey. You must complete the survey in order to get paid.

Note that this is a scientific study.  The answers you provide will only be used to inform our research. Answering questions correctly or incorrectly will not directly impact anyone else.

**Task:**

Imagine you are a fact-checker working for a newspaper. You will be asked to check the accuracy of various claims. For example, for the claim that “States pay more on Medicaid than they do on K12 education”, you would be asked how accurate this claim is. To help you in this fact-checking task, you will be shown a set of newspaper headlines providing support for or against the claim. Review this evidence in making your decision. 

  
**Specifically, for each fact-checking question, you should:**

1.  **Read** each claim
    
2.  **Review** the relevant evidence presented presented for and/or against the claim

    
3.  **Assess** the accuracy of the claim (i.e., how likely it is correct) on a six-point scale
    

4. **Guess** the likelihood that others, reading the same information, would agree with you

Following the fact-checking questions, **you will be asked to complete a ~2 minute survey.**

NOTE. Consider ONLY the evidence shown in assessing the accuracy of each claim. Do NOT search the web or ask others for help in performing the task, which is considered cheating.  We have instrumented the task to detect cheating (e.g., performing a web search), and you will not earn a bonus on any question on which we detect cheating has occurred.
